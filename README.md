# Digital Timer with User Interface
This was a project i made years ago. The goal was to develop a device in my free time with arduino.

<h1>How it works</h1>
The device can control three relays with the help of a joystick and an LCD Display. With the joystick, a specific time is given in which a relay will turn on. 
When this time comes, the relay turns on for a specific time frame, then off again.
In this way, somebody can automate for light to go on automatically at 18:00 and then off again at sleep time around 23:00.

<h1>Things i learned</h1>
<br>-Refresh my arduino knowlegde</br>
<br>-To 3d design and print a case for the circuit (Fusion 360)</br>
<br>-Soldering skills</br>

<h1>Things i would have done differently</h1>
<br>-Create a custom pcb for the circuit instead of having tons of cable inside the case</br>
<br>-Better plan a design for the software so that it can be easier to understand</br>
